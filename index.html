- Doesn't matter if you're Democrat, Republican, or Independent. It's obvious who's responsible for the chaos in the world. The generation of boomers and the generation that comes before the boomers is responsible for the chaos in the world. Who controls Washington D.C.? Who runs the Banks? Who runs the education system? Who starts these wars? It ain't millennials. So clearly it's time for intelligent Millenials to run the country. Hopefully these files reach a Millennial member of the Royal family because boomers are out of touch in today's society.
